# JavaScript Error Fix - Summary

## Problem
A JavaScript error occurred when running the application after installation using the installer generated by the workflow at https://github.com/gauti2609/SMBC/actions/runs/18477243050/workflow

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Configuration File Mismatch
**Issue**: The `package.json` file referenced `electron-builder.config.js` in the build configuration, but the actual file was named `electron-builder.config.cjs`.

**Impact**: This could cause electron-builder to fail to load the configuration or use default settings, leading to improperly packaged applications.

**Fix**: Updated `Financials Automation/package.json` line 104 to reference the correct file:
```json
"build": {
  "extends": "./electron-builder.config.cjs"
}
```

### 2. Missing Prisma Dependencies in Package
**Issue**: Prisma Client and related native modules need to be unpacked from the asar archive to function properly in Electron applications. Without this, the database client fails to load at runtime, causing JavaScript errors.

**Impact**: The application would fail when trying to access the database, showing JavaScript errors related to missing modules.

**Fix**: Updated `Financials Automation/electron-builder.config.cjs` to include:
- Added `prisma/**/*` and `generated/**/*` to the `files` array
- Added new `asarUnpack` configuration to unpack Prisma-related modules:
```javascript
asarUnpack: [
  'node_modules/@prisma/**/*',
  'node_modules/.prisma/**/*',
  'node_modules/prisma/**/*',
  'prisma/**/*',
  'generated/**/*'
]
```

### 3. TypeScript Module Compilation Settings
**Issue**: The `build:electron` script was compiling TypeScript files without explicit module settings, which could lead to inconsistent module resolution.

**Impact**: Potential issues with ES module imports in the Electron main process.

**Fix**: Updated `Financials Automation/package.json` line 30 to include explicit module settings:
```json
"build:electron": "tsc electron/main.ts --outDir electron --target es2020 --module es2020 --moduleResolution node && tsc electron/preload.ts --outDir electron --target es2020 --module es2020 --moduleResolution node"
```

### 4. Workflow Configuration Issue
**Issue**: The workflow had inconsistent working directory settings for the pnpm installation and .env file creation steps.

**Fix**: Updated `.github/workflows/windows-build.yml` to ensure consistent working directory usage.

## How to Regenerate the Installer

### Option 1: Using the Windows Build Workflow (Recommended)

1. Go to the GitHub Actions page: https://github.com/gauti2609/SMBC/actions/workflows/windows-build.yml

2. Click "Run workflow"

3. Wait for the workflow to complete (approximately 10-15 minutes)

4. Download the installer from the workflow artifacts:
   - Navigate to the completed workflow run
   - Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
   - Download "Financial-Statement-Generator-Installer"
   - Extract the .exe files from the downloaded archive

### Option 2: Using the Build Windows Installer Workflow

1. Go to: https://github.com/gauti2609/SMBC/actions/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml

2. Click "Run workflow"

3. Optionally specify a version number (default is 1.0.0)

4. Wait for the workflow to complete

5. Download the artifacts as described above

## Testing the Fixed Installer

After downloading and running the new installer:

1. Install the application on a Windows 10/11 machine
2. Launch the application
3. Verify that:
   - The application starts without JavaScript errors
   - The database connection can be configured
   - Sample data can be imported
   - Financial statements can be generated
   - Excel exports work correctly

## Files Changed

1. `Financials Automation/package.json`
   - Fixed electron-builder config reference
   - Updated build:electron script with explicit module settings

2. `Financials Automation/electron-builder.config.cjs`
   - Added prisma and generated files to the files array
   - Added asarUnpack configuration for Prisma modules

3. `.github/workflows/windows-build.yml`
   - Fixed working directory configuration

## Additional Notes

- The fixes ensure that Prisma Client and other native modules are properly unpacked and accessible at runtime
- The electron-builder configuration now correctly references the .cjs file
- TypeScript compilation now uses explicit ES module settings for consistency
- These changes should eliminate the JavaScript errors that occurred after installation

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after using the regenerated installer:

1. Check that you're using the latest installer from the workflow artifacts
2. Verify that your system meets the requirements (Windows 10/11, 64-bit)
3. Check the application logs for specific error messages
4. Review the error details in the console (if accessible via developer tools)
