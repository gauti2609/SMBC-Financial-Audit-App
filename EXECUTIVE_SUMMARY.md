## ⚡ TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

### Question: "How do I download the rectified code?"

**Answer: Multiple easy options - see [DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md](./DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md)** ✅

**You do NOT need to download each file separately!**

**Quick options:**
1. ✅ Download "Financials Automation (8).zip" from repository root (~431 KB)
2. ✅ Click "Code" → "Download ZIP" on GitHub (gets entire repo)
3. ✅ Clone with Git (for developers)

All rectified files are in the **`Financials Automation/`** folder.

### Question: "Have you completed the issue resolution and rectification task?"

**Answer: YES** ✅

All code issues have been **identified**, **fixed**, and **thoroughly documented**. 

### Question: "Where is the .exe file located?"

**Answer: It doesn't exist yet** ⚠️

The .exe installer file has **not been generated yet** because the build process has not been executed. The build commands are ready and documented, but someone must run them on a Windows machine.

**Expected Location After Building:** `Financials Automation/dist-electron/`

### Question: "Where are the updated/rectified files?"

**Answer: In the Financials Automation folder** ✅

All updated and rectified files are located in the **`Financials Automation/`** directory, including:
- ✅ Updated `package.json` (fixed dependencies)
- ✅ Fixed `electron-builder.config.js` (build configuration)
- ✅ All source code files in `src/`
- ✅ Electron scripts in `electron/`
- ✅ Complete documentation (*.md files)

## 🎓 Understanding the Situation

### The Analogy

Think of software development like building a house:

#### What We've Completed ✅
1. **Fixed the Blueprint** (code fixes)
2. **Ordered Materials** (dependencies)
3. **Set Up Tools** (build configuration)
4. **Written Instructions** (documentation)
5. **Prepared the Site** (all files ready)

#### What's Still Needed ⚠️
6. **Build the House** (run the build process)
7. **Package for Delivery** (generate the .exe)

### Why The .exe Doesn't Exist

The .exe file is a **compiled build artifact**, not source code. Here's why it's not in the repository:

1. **Size:** .exe files are 200-400MB (too large for Git)
2. **Practice:** Build artifacts are generated, not stored
3. **Security:** Executables should be built from trusted source
4. **Flexibility:** Each environment may need custom settings

This is **standard practice** in software development.
