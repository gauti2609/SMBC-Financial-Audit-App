# GitHub Copilot Instructions for SMBC Repository

## Project Overview

This repository contains automation tools for drafting financial statements according to Schedule III of the Companies Act and Indian Accounting Standards. The project focuses on creating Windows-based automation applications that process trial balance data and generate properly formatted financial schedules.

## Key Technologies

- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**: Core automation logic for Excel-based processing
- **Python**: For building Windows executables and additional automation features
- **Excel/XLSM**: Primary data format for trial balances and financial reports
- **Windows 10/11**: Target platform for executable applications

## Project Structure

- `VBA_Module1.bas`: VBA code for financial automation logic
- `Financials_Automation_Tool_11.xlsm`: Excel workbook with VBA macros
- `Schedule III.pdf` & `Schedule III.docx`: Reference documents for financial formatting requirements
- `Sample TB.xlsx` & `Sample TB.txt`: Sample trial balance data for testing
- `Financials Automation.zip`: Web application files generated by previous automation attempts

## Development Guidelines

### Code Changes

1. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Do not remove existing features such as user authentication, licensing systems, or database management unless there's a critical issue that requires discussion
2. **Minimal Changes**: Make surgical, focused changes to address specific issues
3. **Testing**: Always test changes with the sample trial balance files before committing
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation when changing functionality

### VBA Development

- Follow existing naming conventions in `VBA_Module1.bas`
- Ensure Excel compatibility with Windows 10/11 systems
- Test macros with `Sample TB.xlsx` before finalizing changes
- Maintain error handling and user-friendly messages

### Python Development

- Target Python 3.8+ for Windows compatibility
- Use PyInstaller or similar tools for creating Windows executables
- Include all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Test executable creation and installation processes thoroughly

### Dependencies and Build Process

When working with executable creation:
1. Ensure all Python dependencies are properly declared
2. Test the build process on a clean Windows environment if possible
3. Verify all external resources are bundled correctly
4. Include clear installation instructions

### Testing

1. **Sample Data**: Use `Sample TB.xlsx` and `Sample TB.txt` for validation
2. **Schedule III Compliance**: Verify outputs match requirements in `Schedule III.pdf`
3. **Error Handling**: Test edge cases and invalid input scenarios
4. **Windows Compatibility**: Ensure executables run on Windows 10/11 without errors

### Security Considerations

- Never commit credentials, API keys, or sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Secure any authentication or licensing mechanisms
- Review code for potential vulnerabilities before committing

## Common Tasks

### Running VBA Code
1. Open `Financials_Automation_Tool_11.xlsm` in Excel
2. Enable macros if prompted
3. Load sample data from `Sample TB.xlsx`
4. Execute the automation macros

### Creating Windows Executable
1. Review `Financials Automation.zip` for previous build configurations
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Test the build process incrementally
4. Validate the executable on a clean Windows system

### Adding New Features
1. Review existing code in `VBA_Module1.bas` and automation files
2. Identify integration points
3. Implement changes with comprehensive error handling
4. Test with sample data
5. Update documentation

## Issue Resolution Workflow

1. **Understand the Context**: Review related files and documentation
2. **Identify Root Cause**: Analyze error messages and logs thoroughly
3. **Implement Fix**: Make minimal, focused changes
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify the fix with sample data
5. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation and commit messages

## Resources

- Schedule III format requirements: `Schedule III.pdf`
- Sample data for testing: `Sample TB.xlsx`, `Sample TB.txt`
- Previous automation attempts: `Financials Automation.zip`
- VBA reference code: `VBA_Module1.bas`

## Notes for Copilot

- The repository owner has limited coding experience, so provide clear explanations
- Focus on creating robust, production-ready solutions
- Prioritize Windows 10/11 compatibility
- When generating executables, ensure all steps are documented for reproducibility
- Test changes with the provided sample data before considering work complete
