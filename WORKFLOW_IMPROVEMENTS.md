# Windows Build Workflow - Potential Improvements

## Current Status

The main Prisma client import issue has been fixed. The workflow should now succeed through the "Build web application" step.

## Potential Issue: Electron TypeScript Compilation

### Issue
The workflow includes a step to compile Electron TypeScript files:
```yaml
- name: Compile Electron scripts
  run: pnpm run build:electron
  working-directory: Financials Automation
```

This step runs `tsc electron/main.ts` and `tsc electron/preload.ts`, which may have TypeScript compilation issues due to module resolution settings.

### Why This Might Not Be a Problem
1. **Pre-compiled files exist**: The repository already has `electron/main.js` and `electron/preload.js` committed
2. **Platform differences**: The compilation might work correctly on Windows with Node.js 22
3. **Not the original error**: The original error was about Prisma client imports, not Electron compilation

### Recommended Solutions (if needed)

#### Option 1: Skip Electron Compilation (Quick Fix)
Since the JS files are already committed, you could comment out this step:
```yaml
# - name: Compile Electron scripts
#   run: pnpm run build:electron
#   working-directory: Financials Automation
```

#### Option 2: Fix TypeScript Configuration (Proper Fix)
Create a separate `tsconfig.electron.json` for Electron with proper module resolution:
```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es2020",
    "outDir": "./electron",
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["electron/*.ts"]
}
```

Then update the `build:electron` script:
```json
"build:electron": "tsc -p tsconfig.electron.json"
```

#### Option 3: Make Step Continue on Error
Allow the workflow to continue even if this step fails:
```yaml
- name: Compile Electron scripts
  run: pnpm run build:electron
  working-directory: Financials Automation
  continue-on-error: true
```

## Testing Recommendation

After the Prisma fix, try running the workflow first to see if the Electron compilation actually fails on Windows. If it does, then implement one of the solutions above.

## Priority

- **High Priority**: Prisma client import fix âœ… (COMPLETED)
- **Low Priority**: Electron compilation (only if it actually fails in CI)

The Electron compilation issue is likely a non-issue since:
1. The compiled files are already in the repository
2. The error we're fixing was specifically about Prisma imports
3. Windows and Node.js 22 might handle module resolution differently
