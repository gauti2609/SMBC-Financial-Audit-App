## What Was Wrong

**The application was looking for environment variables but couldn't find them.**

Even though you set the system environment variable via PowerShell, it didn't work because:
1. Windows requires a **computer restart** for new environment variables to take effect
2. You didn't restart (nobody mentioned you needed to!)
3. The error message was confusing ("Server file not found" instead of "DATABASE_URL missing")

**This was NOT your fault.** The application should have been easier to configure.

## The Fix (Merged in This PR)

I've made the configuration **MUCH simpler**:

### ‚ú® New Easy Method: Create a Config File

Instead of setting system environment variables, you can now just create a text file!

**Step 1:** Open File Explorer and paste this into the address bar:
```
%APPDATA%\Financial Statement Generator
```

**Step 2:** Create a new text file named `config.env`
- Important: Make sure it's `config.env` NOT `config.env.txt`
- Windows may hide file extensions - in File Explorer, go to View ‚Üí check "File name extensions"

**Step 3:** Open the file with Notepad and add this line:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/financialsdb
```
Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual PostgreSQL password.

**Step 4:** Save the file and launch the application!

**That's it!** No PowerShell, no Admin rights, no computer restart needed! üéâ

## Need Help?

After installing the new version, if you still have issues:

1. **Check the error message** - it will now tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Read the setup guide** - click the desktop shortcut "Setup Instructions"
3. **Verify your config.env**:
   - Location: `%APPDATA%\Financial Statement Generator\config.env`
   - Content: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/financialsdb`
   - Password is correct (test it in PGAdmin4)

4. **If still stuck**, open a new issue with:
   - Screenshot of the error
   - Content of your config.env file (hide your password: use `***`)
   - PostgreSQL version

## My Apologies

I understand your frustration. You did everything right, but the application made it harder than it needed to be.

This fix makes it work the way you expected from the beginning: **simple, straightforward, no gotchas.**

You shouldn't need to be a Windows PowerShell expert to configure a database connection. Just create one text file and you're done.

Thank you for reporting this issue and for your patience! üôè
