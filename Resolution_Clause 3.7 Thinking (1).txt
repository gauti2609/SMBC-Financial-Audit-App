Prisma Build Error Analysis
Based on the build log, I can see your SMBC Financial Audit App is encountering an error during the build process related to Prisma module resolution.

What's Working
Prisma client generation is successful initially (prisma generate completes)
The verification script confirms that Prisma is properly set up
The application routers (trpc, debug, client) build successfully
The Error
The build fails with:

Code
ERROR  TypeError [ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER]: Invalid module ".prisma" is not a valid package name imported from C:\Financials Automation_Github\Financials Automation\Financials Automation\node_modules\@prisma\client\default.js
What's Happening
This is a module resolution issue during the Nitro Server build phase. The Prisma client is trying to import from a .prisma path, which is being rejected as an invalid module specifier.

Potential Causes and Solutions
Prisma Version Compatibility:

You're using Prisma v6.8.2, which might have module resolution issues with your build system
Solution: Try downgrading to a stable version (like 4.x or 5.x) or check if there's a newer version that fixes this issue
Build Configuration Issue:

The error occurs specifically during the node-server build phase
Solution: You may need to adjust your Nitro or Vinxi configuration to handle Prisma's module resolution
Duplicate Configuration Keys:

The warning about duplicate externals keys in app.config.ts (lines 47 and 68) might be related
Solution: Fix the duplicate keys to ensure proper build configuration
Environment Setup:

Check if your development environment differs from production in ways that affect Prisma
Next Steps
Fix the duplicate externals keys in your app.config.ts file
Try upgrading/downgrading Prisma to a version known to work with your stack
Add explicit externals for Prisma in your build configuration
Check Prisma's documentation for known issues with your specific build setup
