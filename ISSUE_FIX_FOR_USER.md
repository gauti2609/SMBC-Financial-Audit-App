# Installation Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## The Problem You Experienced

You followed all the steps from PR #37:
- ✅ Rebuilt the installer
- ✅ Set system environment variable through PowerShell admin
- ✅ Created PostgreSQL database
- ❌ **Still got "Server file not found" error**

This was frustrating because you did everything correctly, but the application still wouldn't start.

## What Was Wrong

The issue was **NOT** with your setup. The problem was in the application code:

1. **Environment variables weren't being loaded** - The Electron app only checked system environment variables from `process.env`, but didn't load them from a configuration file
2. **System environment variables require a restart** - Even though you set the variable via PowerShell, Windows requires a **computer restart** for new environment variables to take effect
3. **No clear error messages** - When the DATABASE_URL wasn't found, the error message said "Server file not found" which was misleading

## The Fix

I've completely overhauled how the application handles configuration:

### 1. Config File Support (NEW - RECOMMENDED METHOD)

You can now create a simple `config.env` file instead of using system environment variables. This is:
- **Easier** - just create one text file
- **Faster** - no computer restart needed
- **Clearer** - you can see and edit your settings anytime

**How to do it:**

1. Open File Explorer
2. Paste this into the address bar: `%APPDATA%\Financial Statement Generator`
   - Or manually go to: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Financial Statement Generator`
3. Create a new text file named `config.env` (NOT `config.env.txt`)
4. Open it with Notepad and add this line:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/financialsdb
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual PostgreSQL password
5. Save the file
6. Launch the application - it will work immediately!

### 2. Better Error Messages

If you don't have the config file, the error message now tells you:
- Exactly where to create the config.env file
- What to put in it
- Links to detailed documentation

### 3. Post-Installation Guidance

After installing the new version, you'll see:
- **Message box** with critical setup steps
- **Desktop shortcut** to detailed setup instructions
- **Bundled documentation** in the installation folder

## How to Get the Fixed Version

### Option A: Build Locally (If You Have the Development Setup)

```bash
cd "Financials Automation"
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run build:electron
pnpm run electron:dist:win
```

The installer will be in: `dist-electron/Financial Statement Generator-Setup-*.exe`

### Option B: Wait for GitHub Release (Easier)

Once this PR is merged, a GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Build the installer automatically
2. Create a release with the .exe file
3. You can download and install it directly

## Setup Steps with Fixed Version

1. **Uninstall old version** (if you have one installed)

2. **Install new version** from the .exe installer
   - You'll see a message box with setup instructions
   - A desktop shortcut "Setup Instructions" will be created

3. **Create the database** (if not already done)
   - Open PGAdmin4
   - Right-click "Databases" → Create → Database
   - Name: `financialsdb`
   - Save

4. **Create config.env file**
   - Press Windows + R
   - Type: `%APPDATA%\Financial Statement Generator` and press Enter
   - Right-click → New → Text Document
   - Name it: `config.env` (delete `.txt` if it appears)
   - Open with Notepad
   - Add: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/financialsdb`
   - Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your PostgreSQL password
   - Save and close

5. **Launch the application**
   - Double-click the desktop icon
   - Wait 5-10 seconds for server to start
   - You should see the login screen!

## No More Frustration

With this fix:
- ✅ **No system environment variables needed** (unless you prefer that method)
- ✅ **No computer restart required**
- ✅ **Clear error messages** if something is missing
- ✅ **Step-by-step guides** included with the installer
- ✅ **Works immediately** after creating config.env file

## Detailed Documentation

The new installer includes these guides:
- **INSTALLATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Complete step-by-step instructions (6KB guide)
- **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference
- **POSTGRESQL_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Database setup details

All located in: `C:\Program Files\Financial Statement Generator\resources\`

## Still Have Issues?

If you still encounter problems after installing the fixed version:

1. **Check the error message** - it will now tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Verify config.env exists** at `%APPDATA%\Financial Statement Generator\config.env`
3. **Check the file content** - should have DATABASE_URL line
4. **Verify PostgreSQL password** - try connecting with PGAdmin4 using the same password
5. **Open an issue** with:
   - Screenshot of the error
   - Content of config.env (mask your password)
   - PostgreSQL version

## Why This Happened

The original code assumed users would set system environment variables, which:
- Requires administrator privileges
- Requires computer restart
- Is harder to verify and troubleshoot

The new approach uses configuration files like most professional applications, making it much more user-friendly.

## Summary

**Before:** Complex setup with system environment variables, required restart, confusing errors
**After:** Simple config file, works immediately, clear instructions

This is not your fault - it was a design issue in the application. The fix makes it work the way you expected it to work from the beginning.

Thank you for your patience!
