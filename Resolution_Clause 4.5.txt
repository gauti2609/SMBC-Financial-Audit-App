I can see the issue - you're encountering a build error with Prisma Client when building your application. The error occurs because the build process (using Nitro/Rollup) is trying to bundle the Prisma Client, but Prisma generates platform-specific binaries that shouldn't be bundled.

The error message indicates:

Code
Invalid module ".prisma" is not a valid package name imported from C:\Financials Automation_Github\Financials Automation\Financials Automation\node_modules\@prisma\client\default.js
Solution
You need to configure your build system to externalize Prisma. I can see in your app.config.ts that you already have some externals configuration (with a duplicate warning), but it needs to be properly configured for Prisma.

Let me help you fix this by updating your configuration:Based on the build log, you're experiencing a Prisma build error with the invalid module .prisma during the Nitro bundling step. Here's how to resolve this:

Issues Identified:
Duplicate externals key in app.config.ts (lines 47 and 68)
Invalid module resolution for .prisma during the Nitro build process
Prisma client bundling issues with the node-server preset
Solutions:
1. Fix the Duplicate externals Key
In your app.config.ts, you have two externals configurations in the nitro section. Merge them into one:


app.config.ts
nitro: {
  experimental: {
    wasm: true,
  },
  rollupConfig: {
    external: [
2. Add Prisma Post-Build Configuration
Add a node_modules/.prisma external resolution. Update the nitro.rollupConfig.external array:

TypeScript
rollupConfig: {
  external: [
    "@prisma/client", 
    ".prisma/client", 
    "@prisma/engines",
    "@prisma/engines-version",
    /node_modules\/.prisma/,
    /node_modules\/@prisma/,
  ],
}
3. Configure Nitro to Skip Prisma Tracing
Update your nitro configuration:

TypeScript
nitro: {
  // ... existing config
  noExternal: [],
  external: [
    "@prisma/client",
    ".prisma/client",
  ],
  // Disable module tracing for Prisma
  moduleSideEffects: (id) => !id.includes('@prisma') && !id.includes('.prisma'),
}
4. Alternative: Copy Prisma Generated Files
Add a build script to copy Prisma files after generation. Create/update scripts/postbuild.js:


scripts/postbuild.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const prismaClientPath = path.join(__dirname, '../node_modules/.prisma/client');
const outputPath = path.join(__dirname, '../.output/server/node_modules/.prisma/client');

Then update your package.json:

JSON
"scripts": {
  "build": "vinxi build && node scripts/postbuild.js",
}
5. Quick Fix: Remove Regex Patterns
The .prisma bare import is causing issues. Remove these problematic lines from your external arrays:

Line 28: ".prisma",
Line 32: /^\.prisma\/.*/,
Keep only the full paths like ".prisma/client".

Recommended approach: Apply fixes #1, #2, and #5 together, then rebuild. This should resolve the module resolution error during the Nitro bundling step.
