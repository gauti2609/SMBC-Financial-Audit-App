# Complete Installation Guide - Step by Step

> **For users without coding background** - This guide provides clear instructions with expected outputs at each step.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- [ ] Administrator access to your computer
- [ ] Internet connection

---

## Step 1: Install Node.js

### What to do:
1. Download Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/
2. Choose **LTS version** (Long Term Support) - Should be version 20.x or higher
3. Run the installer
4. Click "Next" through all steps (keep default settings)
5. Click "Install"

### Verify Installation:
Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter) and run:
```bash
node --version
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should see:
```
v20.x.x
```
(where x can be any number)

❌ **FAIL** - If you see:
```
'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
**Solution**: Restart your computer and try the verify step again.

---

## Step 2: Install pnpm (Package Manager)

### What to do:
In Command Prompt, run:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - Installation completes and you see:
```
added 1 package in Xs
```

### Verify Installation:
```bash
pnpm --version
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should see:
```
9.x.x or 10.x.x
```

❌ **FAIL** - If you see an error:
**Solution**: Close Command Prompt and open a new one, then try again.

---

## Step 3: Navigate to Project Directory

### What to do:
In Command Prompt, navigate to your project folder:
```bash
cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Financials Automation"
```

**Example:**
```bash
cd "C:\Financials Automation_Github\Financials Automation"
```

### Verify You're in the Right Place:
```bash
dir
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should see files including:
```
package.json
prisma
src
README.md
```

❌ **FAIL** - If you don't see these files:
**Solution**: You're in the wrong directory. Use Windows Explorer to find the correct folder path.

---

## Step 4: Create Environment File

### What to do:
1. In the project folder, find `config.env.template`
2. Copy it and rename the copy to `.env`
3. Open `.env` with Notepad
4. Update these values:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/financialsdb
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should have a file named `.env` in your project folder

❌ **FAIL** - If Windows won't let you create `.env`:
**Solution**: In Command Prompt, run:
```bash
copy config.env.template .env
```

---

## Step 5: Clean Previous Installation (If Any)

### What to do:
If this is your first installation, **skip this step**.

If you tried installing before and had errors, run:
```bash
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del pnpm-lock.yaml
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - Commands complete without error (or files not found is OK)

---

## Step 6: Install Dependencies

### What to do:
Run this command (this may take 2-5 minutes):
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should see:
```
Packages: +1100 (approximate number)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Progress: resolved xxxx, reused xxxx, downloaded xxx, added xxxx

> first-project@ postinstall
> echo 'Generating TanStack Router...' && tsr generate

Generating TanStack Router...

Done in XXs using pnpm vX.X.X
```

**Key indicators of success:**
- ✅ No error messages at the end
- ✅ "Done in XXs" message appears
- ✅ Exit code is 0 (not shown but no error)

❌ **FAIL** - If you see:
```
Cannot find module 'query_engine_bg.postgresql.wasm-base64.js'
ELIFECYCLE Command failed with exit code 1.
```

**Solution**: This should not happen anymore with the fix. If it does, contact support with the error message.

❌ **FAIL** - If you see network/download errors:
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and run `pnpm install` again.

## Step 7: Setup Prisma (CRITICAL STEP)

### What to do:
Run this command:
```bash
pnpm run setup
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should see:
```
> first-project@ setup
> node scripts/setup-prisma.js

🔧 Setting up Prisma Client...
✅ @prisma/client package found
⏳ Waiting for package extraction to complete...
🔄 Generating Prisma client...

✔ Generated Prisma Client (v6.8.2, engine=binary) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in XXXms

✅ Prisma client files verified
🎉 Prisma setup completed successfully!
```

**Key indicators of success:**
- ✅ All checkmarks (✅) are shown
- ✅ "engine=binary" is mentioned
- ✅ "Prisma setup completed successfully!" appears

❌ **FAIL** - If you see:
```
⚠️ Warning: .env file not found
```
**Solution**: Go back to Step 4 and create the .env file.

❌ **FAIL** - If you see:

```
**Solution**: 
1. Check if .env file exists
2. Run: `pnpm install` again
3. Then run: `pnpm run setup` again

## Step 8: Verify Installation

### What to do:
Run this command to verify everything is working:
```bash
pnpm run verify-prisma
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should see:
```
🔍 Verifying Prisma setup...
✅ Prisma schema found
✅ DATABASE_URL configured
✅ Prisma schema is valid
🔄 Generating Prisma client...
✅ Prisma client generated successfully
✅ Prisma client files found

```

**Key indicators of success:**
- ✅ All checks pass with checkmarks
- ✅ "verification completed successfully!" appears

❌ **FAIL** - If any check fails:
**Solution**: Note which check failed and refer to the error message. Common issues:

3. Test connection to your database

❌ **FAIL** - If you see port already in use:
**Solution**: 
1. Another application is using port 3000
2. Close other applications or change the port

---

## Step 10: Build for Production (Optional)

To build the complete application, run:
```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Expected Output:
✅ **PASS** - You should see:

## Troubleshooting Reference

### Quick Checks if Something Goes Wrong

1. **Verify Node.js version:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Should show v20.x.x or higher

2. **Verify pnpm version:**
   ```bash
   pnpm --version
   ```

   dir .env
   ```
   Should show the file

### Common Error Solutions
