## Error Resolution Details

### Original Error 1: Missing Export
```
[vite] The requested module '@tanstack/react-start/server' does not provide an export named 'toWebRequest'
```
**Resolution:** ✅ Fixed by importing from `h3` package instead

### Original Error 2: Invalid Prisma Module  
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER]: Invalid module ".prisma" is not a valid package name
```
**Resolution:** ✅ This was a downstream error that resolved automatically once Error 1 was fixed. The Prisma configuration was already correct.

---

## No Breaking Changes

✅ All existing functionality preserved  
✅ No API changes  
✅ No database schema changes  
✅ No configuration file changes  
✅ Minimal code changes (2 import statements)  

---

## Commands Verified

All the following commands work without errors:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install                    ✅ Working

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm run generate               ✅ Working

# Verify Prisma setup
pnpm run verify-prisma          ✅ Working

# Start development server
pnpm run dev                    ✅ Working

# Build for production
pnpm run build                  ✅ Working
```

---

## Technical Background

The issue occurred because:
- Vinxi uses **Nitro** as its server engine
- Nitro uses **h3** as its HTTP framework
- The functions `defineEventHandler` and `toWebRequest` are provided by **h3**, not by `@tanstack/react-start/server`
- The code was attempting to import from the wrong package

The fix was simple: import from the correct package (`h3`) that actually provides these utilities.

---

## Conclusion

Both `pnpm run dev` and `pnpm run build` now work perfectly without any errors. The application is ready for development and deployment.

**Fix Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
