# ✅ UNENV COMPATIBILITY ISSUE - RESOLVED

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Issue**: `pnpm run dev` and `pnpm run build` failing with unenv module errors  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Statement

Users encountered the following errors when running development and build commands:

```
✘ [ERROR] Cannot find module 'unenv/node/inspector/promises' from '.'
✘ [ERROR] Cannot find module 'unenv/mock/empty' from '.'
✘ [ERROR] Missing "./node/process" specifier in "unenv" package
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by an incompatibility between two dependencies:
- `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` v0.23.0 expected import paths like `unenv/node/*` and `unenv/mock/*`
- `unenv` v1.10.0 changed its export structure to use `unenv/runtime/node/*` and `unenv/runtime/mock/*`
- The plugin's hardcoded paths no longer matched the actual exports

## Solution

Downgraded `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` from v0.23.0 to v0.17.0, which is compatible with the current `unenv` version.

### Code Change

**File**: `package.json`
```diff
- "vite-plugin-node-polyfills": "^0.23.0",
+ "vite-plugin-node-polyfills": "^0.17.0",
```

## Verification

### ✅ Development Server
```bash
$ pnpm run dev
> vinxi dev
vinxi v0.5.3
vinxi starting dev server
➜ Local:    http://localhost:3000/
➜ Network:  http://10.1.0.160:3000/
```

### ✅ Production Build
```bash
$ pnpm run build
⚙  Building your app...
⚙ Built your router trpc successfully
⚙ Built your router debug successfully  
⚙ Built your router client successfully
[success] [vinxi] Nitro Server built
```

## For New Users

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Setup environment

## Impact

- ✅ Development workflow restored
- ✅ Build process working correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to functionality
- ⚠️ Peer dependency warning (vite@6 vs expected 2-5) - can be ignored

## Future Considerations

Monitor `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` for updates that support:
- unenv v1.10.0+ compatibility
- vite 6.x peer dependency support

When both are available, consider upgrading back to the latest version.
