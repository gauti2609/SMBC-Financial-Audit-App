# ✅ Build and Dev Errors - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary

The application was experiencing critical errors when running `pnpm run dev` and `pnpm run build`:

### Error 1: Missing Export from @tanstack/react-start/server
```
[vite] The requested module '@tanstack/react-start/server' does not provide an export named 'toWebRequest'
```

### Error 2: Invalid Prisma Module
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER]: Invalid module ".prisma" is not a valid package name
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Import Error
The code was attempting to import `defineEventHandler` and `toWebRequest` from `@tanstack/react-start/server`, but these functions are actually provided by the **h3** package, which is the underlying HTTP framework used by Vinxi/Nitro.

**Affected Files:**
- `src/server/trpc/handler.ts`
- `src/server/debug/client-logs-handler.ts`

### 2. Prisma Module Resolution
The second error was actually a false alarm - the Prisma configuration in `app.config.ts` and `vinxi.config.ts` was already correctly externalizing Prisma dependencies. The error only appeared because the first error prevented the build from completing properly.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### File: `src/server/trpc/handler.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
import { defineEventHandler, toWebRequest } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { defineEventHandler, toWebRequest } from "h3";
```

#### File: `src/server/debug/client-logs-handler.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
import { defineEventHandler, toWebRequest } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { defineEventHandler, toWebRequest } from "h3";
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Development Server Test
```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```
**Result:** Server starts successfully on `http://localhost:3000/` without any errors.

### ✅ Production Build Test
```bash
$ pnpm run build
```
**Result:** Build completes successfully with all routers compiled:
- ✅ trpc router built
- ✅ debug router built  
- ✅ client router built
- ✅ Nitro Server built

## Technical Details

### Why h3?

Vinxi (the build tool used in this project) uses Nitro as its server engine, which in turn uses **h3** as its HTTP framework. The h3 package provides:

- `defineEventHandler` - For creating event handlers
- `toWebRequest` - For converting h3 events to standard Web Request objects
- And many other utilities for handling HTTP requests/responses

These utilities are designed to work seamlessly with the server-side rendering and API routes in the Vinxi/TanStack Start ecosystem.

### About the Prisma Configuration

The existing Prisma externalization configuration was already correct:

**In `app.config.ts`:**
```typescript
rollupConfig: {
  external: [
    "@prisma/client", 
    ".prisma/client", 
    ".prisma",
    "@prisma/engines",
    "@prisma/engines-version",
  ],
}
```

**In `vinxi.config.ts`:**
```typescript
external: [
  '@prisma/client',
  '.prisma/client',
  '.prisma',
  '@prisma/engines',
  // ... other externals
]
```

This ensures Prisma is not bundled during the build process, which would cause module resolution errors.

## No Breaking Changes

✅ All existing functionality remains intact  
✅ No API changes  
✅ No database schema changes  
✅ No configuration changes required  
✅ Only import statements were updated  

## Commands to Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm run generate

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Verify Prisma setup (optional)
pnpm run verify-prisma
```

## Conclusion

The issue was a simple import path error where functions were being imported from the wrong package. By correcting the imports to use the `h3` package (which is the actual provider of these utilities), both development and production builds now work perfectly.

**Date Fixed:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved and Verified
