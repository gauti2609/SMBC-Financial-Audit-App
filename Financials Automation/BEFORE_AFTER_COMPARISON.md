# Before & After: Prisma Installation Fix

## ❌ BEFORE (Broken)

### Installation Process:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### What Happened:
```
Packages: +1151
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

> first-project@ postinstall
> echo 'Generating TanStack Router...' && tsr generate && 
  echo 'Generating Prisma client...' && prisma generate

'Generating TanStack Router...'
'Generating Prisma client...'
Prisma schema loaded from prisma\schema.prisma

Error:
Cannot find module 'C:\...\node_modules\@prisma\client\runtime\query_engine_bg.postgresql.wasm-base64.js'

 ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 1.
```

### Problems:
1. ❌ Race condition - prisma generate ran too early
2. ❌ Version mismatch - CLI 6.17.1 vs Client 6.8.2
3. ❌ WASM engine issues - missing files
4. ❌ Installation fails completely

---

## ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
