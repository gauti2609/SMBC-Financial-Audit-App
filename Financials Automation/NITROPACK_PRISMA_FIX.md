# Nitropack Prisma Client Bundling Fix

## Problem
The Vinxi build was failing with an `ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER` error related to Prisma and Nitropack. This error occurred because Nitropack was trying to externalize the Prisma client, but the module resolution was failing for the `.prisma/client` internal package.

## Root Cause
The original configuration had `externals.inline: []`, which meant no modules were marked for inlining (bundling). The Prisma client needs to be explicitly marked as an inline dependency for Nitropack to bundle it correctly, rather than trying to externalize it.

## Solution
Updated `app.config.ts` to configure Nitropack to inline (bundle) the Prisma client by adding it to the `externals.inline` array:

```typescript
// Configure Nitro to inline (bundle) Prisma client to resolve module specifier errors
externals: {
  inline: [
    '@prisma/client',
    '.prisma/client',
  ],
  traceInclude: [],
  trace: false,
},
```

## What This Does
- **`inline: ['@prisma/client', '.prisma/client']`**: Tells Nitropack to bundle these modules into the server output, rather than treating them as external dependencies
- This resolves the `ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER` error by ensuring the Prisma client is properly included in the build
- The Prisma client files are correctly placed in `.output/server/node_modules/.prisma/client/`

## Verification
✅ Build completes successfully without errors  
✅ No `ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER` errors  
✅ Prisma client properly bundled in `.output/server/`  
✅ Server can start without Prisma module resolution errors  

## Files Changed
- `Financials Automation/app.config.ts` (lines 56-64)
