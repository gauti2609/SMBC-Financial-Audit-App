# Prisma Build Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
The build was failing with the error:
```
Error: Could not load D:/a/SMBC/SMBC/Financials Automation/generated/prisma 
(imported by .vinxi/build/trpc/trpc/trpc.js): ENOENT: no such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
Multiple issues were causing the build failure:

1. **Incorrect Prisma Import**: `src/server/db.ts` was importing from `@prisma/client` instead of the custom location `~/generated/prisma`
2. **Path Resolution Issue**: During Nitro server build, the `~` alias resolved to `/generated/prisma` instead of `/src/generated/prisma`
3. **Electron Configuration**: Electron builder was looking for `dist/**/*` but Vinxi outputs to `.output/**/*`
4. **Electron Main Path**: Electron main.ts was loading from wrong directory

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Prisma Client Imports
- Updated `src/server/db.ts` to import from `~/generated/prisma` instead of `@prisma/client`
- This ensures consistency with the custom Prisma output location defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`

### 2. Created Symlink for Path Resolution
- Created symlink: `generated -> src/generated`
- Added automated script: `scripts/setup-prisma-symlink.js`
- Updated `package.json` to create symlink during:
  - `postinstall` - After dependencies are installed
  - `prebuild` - Before build starts

### 3. Updated Nitro Configuration
Added to `app.config.ts`:
- Nitro alias: `"~/generated/prisma": "./src/generated/prisma"`
- Comprehensive Prisma externals patterns
- Server assets configuration to include Prisma files

### 4. Updated Electron Configuration
- Updated `electron-builder.config.cjs` to use `.output/**/*` instead of `dist/**/*`
- Added `src/generated/prisma/**/*` to included files
- Updated `electron/main.ts` to load from `../.output/public/index.html`

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/db.ts` - Fixed Prisma import path
2. `app.config.ts` - Added Nitro alias and externals
3. `package.json` - Added symlink creation to scripts
4. `scripts/setup-prisma-symlink.js` - New symlink automation script
5. `electron-builder.config.cjs` - Updated paths for .output
6. `electron/main.ts` - Updated to load from .output
7. `electron/main.cjs` - Rebuilt with new path

## How to Build Windows Installer

### Local Build (Windows)
```bash
cd "Financials Automation"

# Install dependencies (creates symlink automatically)
pnpm install

# Build web application
pnpm run build

# Build Electron scripts
pnpm run build:electron

# Create Windows installer
pnpm run electron:dist:win
```

The installer will be created in: `dist-electron/Financial Statement Generator-Setup-*.exe`

### GitHub Actions Build
The build is now fully automated in `.github/workflows/build-windows-installer.yml`

To trigger a build:
1. **Tag-based build**: Push a tag matching `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Manual build**: Go to Actions → "Build Windows Installer" → "Run workflow"

The workflow will:
1. ✅ Install dependencies (symlink created automatically)
2. ✅ Build web application
3. ✅ Build Electron scripts
4. ✅ Create Windows installer
5. ✅ Upload installer as artifact
6. ✅ Create GitHub release (if triggered by tag)

## Build Output Structure

After successful build:
```
Financials Automation/
├── .output/                    # Vinxi build output
│   ├── public/                 # Static web assets
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── server/                 # Server-side code
│       └── index.mjs
├── dist-electron/              # Electron installer output
│   └── Financial Statement Generator-Setup-*.exe
├── generated -> src/generated  # Symlink (created automatically)
└── src/generated/prisma/       # Prisma client (generated during install)
```

## Verification Steps

To verify the build works correctly:

1. **Clean build test**:
   ```bash
   # Remove all build artifacts
   rm -rf .output .vinxi generated node_modules/.cache
   
   # Run full build
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Check symlink**:
   ```bash
   ls -la | grep generated
   # Should show: generated -> src/generated
   ```

3. **Check Prisma client**:
   ```bash
   ls -la src/generated/prisma/
   # Should show: index.js, index.d.ts, and other Prisma files
   ```

4. **Check build output**:
   ```bash
   ls -la .output/public/
   # Should show: index.html and assets/
   ```

## Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

During build, you may see these warnings - they are **safe to ignore**:

1. **BigInt warnings**:
   ```
   [plugin esbuild] src/generated/prisma/runtime/library.js: 
   Big integer literals are not available in the configured target environment
   ```
   - This is from Prisma's runtime library
   - Does not affect functionality
   - Prisma code is externalized, not executed during build

2. **Deprecation warnings**:
   ```
   DeprecationWarning: Use of deprecated trailing slash pattern mapping
   ```
   - This is from @prisma/client package
   - Will be fixed in future Prisma versions
   - Does not affect build or runtime

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Symlink already exists" error
**Solution**: The symlink is already created. No action needed.

### Issue: "generated directory not found"
**Solution**: Run `node scripts/setup-prisma-symlink.js` or `npm run prebuild`

### Issue: Prisma client not found
**Solution**: Run `prisma generate` or reinstall dependencies with `npm install`

### Issue: Build fails with different error
**Solution**: 
1. Clean all build artifacts: `rm -rf .output .vinxi node_modules/.cache generated`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Run build: `npm run build`

## Testing Checklist

Before releasing, verify:

- [x] ✅ Build completes without errors
- [x] ✅ Symlink created automatically
- [x] ✅ Dev server starts successfully
- [x] ✅ Electron scripts compile
- [ ] ⏳ Windows installer created (requires Windows environment or GitHub Actions)
- [ ] ⏳ Installer runs and application launches
- [ ] ⏳ Database connection works
- [ ] ⏳ File upload/download features work

## Next Steps

1. **Trigger GitHub Actions Build**:
   - Push a version tag to create release build
   - Or manually trigger workflow for testing

2. **Download and Test Installer**:
   - Download from GitHub Actions artifacts
   - Or from GitHub Releases (if tag-based build)
   - Install on Windows machine
   - Test all features

3. **Deploy**:
   - Distribute installer to users
   - Users can download from GitHub Releases
   - Or from internal distribution system

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review build logs in GitHub Actions
3. Check that all modified files are committed
4. Verify Node.js version (18+ required)
5. Ensure pnpm is installed (version 8+)
