## 5-Step Setup

### Step 1: Verify Workflow File Exists (30 seconds)

Check if this file exists in your repository:

```bash
cd "Financials Automation"
git add .github/workflows/windows-build-test.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Watch It Run (2 minutes)

1. Go to the **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. You'll see "Windows Build and Test" running
3. Click on it to watch progress

### Step 5: View Results (1 minute)

After ~5-10 minutes:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark = Build successful
- ‚ùå Red X = Build failed (click to see logs)
- Download artifacts at the bottom of the run page

## That's It! üéâ

Your repository now has automated Windows testing. Every time you push code:

1. GitHub Actions automatically starts
2. Sets up a clean Windows environment
3. Installs all dependencies
4. Builds your application
5. Runs tests
6. Uploads build artifacts

---

## What Runs Automatically

Every push to `main` or `develop` triggers:

1. **Install Dependencies**: `pnpm install`
2. **Verify Prisma**: `pnpm run verify-prisma`
3. **Type Check**: `pnpm run typecheck`
4. **Lint**: `pnpm run lint`
5. **Build**: `pnpm run build`
6. **Compile Electron**: `pnpm run build:electron`
7. **Run Diagnostics**: `node diagnostic-test.mjs`

On `main` branch only:
8. **Generate Windows Installer**: `pnpm run electron:dist:win`

2. Scroll to bottom ‚Üí "Artifacts" section
3. Click "windows-installer" to download

### Q: What if the build fails?
**A**: 
1. Click on the failed run
2. Click on the failed step (red X)
3. Read the error message
4. Fix the issue and push again

### Q: Can I run it manually?
**A**: Yes! 
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Windows Build and Test"
2. Click "Run workflow" button

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running?

Check:
1. Is GitHub Actions enabled? (Settings ‚Üí Actions)
2. Is the workflow file in `.github/workflows/`?
3. Did you push to `main` or `develop` branch?

### Build Failing?

Common fixes:
```bash
# Locally test the same commands
cd "Financials Automation"
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run build:electron
```

If it works locally but fails on GitHub:
- Check if all files are committed
- Verify `.env.template` exists
- Ensure `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed
