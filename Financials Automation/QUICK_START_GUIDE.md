# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - After Fix

## ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved!

The build and dev errors have been completely fixed. Here's how to get started:

---

## First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Setup Prisma (generates Prisma client)
pnpm run setup

# 3. Start development server
pnpm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000/**

---

## Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Just run dev - Prisma is auto-generated before starting
pnpm run dev
```

---

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm run build

# The build will automatically:
# 1. Generate Prisma client
# 2. Verify Prisma setup
# 3. Build all routers
# 4. Generate production output in .output/
```
