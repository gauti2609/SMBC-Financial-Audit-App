# PR Summary: Fix Installation Environment Variable Issue

## Problem Statement

Users were experiencing installation failures even after following all documented steps from PR #37:
- Rebuilt the installer
- Set system environment variable via PowerShell (Admin)
- Created PostgreSQL database
- Still received "Server file not found" error

The issue was frustrating because users did everything correctly but the application wouldn't start.

## Root Cause Analysis

The Electron application in production had three critical issues:

1. **No config file support** - Only read from `process.env`, didn't load from .env files
2. **Required computer restart** - System environment variables need a restart to take effect (often missed)
3. **Misleading error messages** - When DATABASE_URL was missing, showed "Server file not found" instead of "DATABASE_URL not configured"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Loading System

Added `loadEnvironmentVariables()` function in `electron/main.ts` that:
- Loads from multiple locations (in priority order):
  1. System environment variables (highest priority)
  2. `%APPDATA%\Financial Statement Generator\config.env` (user-specific)
  3. `resources\config.env` (installation-wide)  
  4. `resources\.env` (bundled)
- Parses .env format (key=value, comments, empty lines)
- System env vars take precedence over file values
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Clear Error Messages

Enhanced `startServer()` to:
- Check DATABASE_URL before attempting to start
- Show actionable error with:
  - Exact file path where to create config.env
  - Required format
  - Three configuration methods
  - Links to documentation

### 3. Installer Improvements  

Updated `installer.nsh` to:
- Create AppData directory during installation
- Show critical setup instructions in message box
- Create desktop shortcut to setup guide

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

Added three new guides:
- **INSTALLATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md** (6KB) - Step-by-step for end users
- **ENV_VAR_FIX_SUMMARY.md** (7KB) - Technical details for developers
- **ISSUE_FIX_FOR_USER.md** (6KB) - Explains the problem and solution

Updated `electron-builder.config.cjs` to bundle:
- config.env.template
- INSTALLATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Existing guides (QUICK_START.md, POSTGRESQL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### 5. Build Script Updates

Updated `build-windows.bat` to show:
- Critical setup requirements after build
- Where documentation files are located
- What users must do before launching

## Configuration Methods

Users now have three ways to configure DATABASE_URL:

### Method A: config.env File (RECOMMENDED)
```
Location: %APPDATA%\Financial Statement Generator\config.env
Content: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/financialsdb
Benefits: No admin, no restart, easy to verify
```

### Method B: Template File
```
Copy config.env.template from installation folder
Rename to config.env, edit password, save
```

### Method C: System Environment Variable (Advanced)
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('DATABASE_URL', 'postgresql://...', 'User')
# Requires computer restart!
```

## Files Changed

### Core Application
- `electron/main.ts` - Added env loading + error handling (97 lines added)
- `electron/main.cjs` - Compiled version
- `electron-builder.config.cjs` - Added resources to installer

### Build & Install
- `build-windows.bat` - Improved post-build instructions
- `installer.nsh` - Added post-install guidance and desktop shortcut

### Documentation
- `INSTALLATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - New comprehensive guide
- `ENV_VAR_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details
- `ISSUE_FIX_FOR_USER.md` - User-facing explanation

### Dependencies
- `package.json` - Added @types/node

## Testing Done

1. ✅ Verified environment loading logic with test script
2. ✅ Confirmed TypeScript compilation succeeds
3. ✅ Verified web application build completes
4. ✅ Confirmed .output/server/index.mjs exists
5. ✅ Validated error messages in code

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Launch
1. User creates config.env with DATABASE_URL
2. App loads environment from file
3. Backend server starts
4. Frontend connects to localhost:3000
5. Login screen displays

### Missing Configuration
1. User hasn't created config.env
2. Clear error dialog appears with:
   - "DATABASE_URL environment variable is not configured"
   - Three configuration methods
   - Exact file paths
   - Documentation references
3. User follows instructions
4. Creates config.env
5. Relaunches successfully

### Post-Installation
1. Message box shows critical setup steps
2. Desktop shortcut "Setup Instructions" created
3. Documentation available in resources folder

## Benefits

- ✅ **No computer restart required** (config file method)
- ✅ **Clear error messages** (no more "Server file not found")
- ✅ **Multiple configuration options** (file, template, env var)
- ✅ **Better discoverability** (post-install message + shortcut)
- ✅ **Self-service troubleshooting** (comprehensive guides)
- ✅ **Production-ready** (standard .env approach)

## Rollout Plan

1. Review and merge this PR
2. Create release tag (e.g., v1.0.1)
3. GitHub Actions builds installer automatically
4. Test on clean Windows machine
5. Publish release with:
   - Updated installer
   - Release notes highlighting config.env method
   - Link to INSTALLATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md

## Breaking Changes

**None.** Fully backward compatible:
- Still supports system environment variables
- Adds new config file support
- Existing installations continue to work

## Support Impact

This fix should significantly reduce support requests:
- Error messages tell users exactly what to do
- Configuration is straightforward (one file)
- No admin privileges or restarts required
- Comprehensive documentation included
- Post-install message prevents missed steps

## Review Checklist

- [x] Environment loading logic implemented
- [x] DATABASE_URL validation added
- [x] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive
- [x] Installer includes all necessary files
- [x] Build script shows setup requirements
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Web application builds successfully

2. Download and test on Windows 10/11
3. Verify all documentation is accessible
4. Test both config file and env var methods
5. Publish release if tests pass
