# Prisma Client Import Fix - Summary

## Problem

The Windows build workflow was failing with the following error:

```
❌ Failed to import Prisma client: Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'
Require stack:
- D:\a\SMBC\SMBC\Financials Automation\node_modules\@prisma\client\default.js
 ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. **Custom Output Location**: The Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) was configured to generate the client to a custom location:
   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
     output   = "../src/generated/prisma"
   }
   ```

2. **Incorrect Imports**: Some files were importing from `@prisma/client` which looks for the client in the default location (`node_modules/.prisma/client`), but the client was actually generated to `src/generated/prisma`.

3. **Verification Script Issue**: The `scripts/verify-prisma` script was trying to import from `@prisma/client`, causing it to fail during the build process.

## Solution

### Files Modified

1. **`scripts/verify-prisma`**
   - Changed from: `import('@prisma/client')`
   - Changed to: Dynamic import from `src/generated/prisma/index.js`

2. **`src/server/trpc/procedures/databaseConnection.ts`**
   - Changed from: `import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"`
   - Changed to: `import { PrismaClient } from "~/generated/prisma"`

3. **`prisma/seed-master-lists.ts`**
   - Changed from: `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'`
   - Changed to: `import { PrismaClient } from '../src/generated/prisma/index.js'`

### Why This Works

- The path alias `~/generated/prisma` is configured in `tsconfig.json` and resolves to `src/generated/prisma`
- This matches the custom output location specified in the Prisma schema
- All other files in the codebase were already using the correct import path

## Verification

The fix was tested and verified:

1. ✅ Prisma client generation successful
2. ✅ Verification script (`pnpm run verify-prisma`) passes
3. ✅ Build process (`pnpm run build`) completes successfully
4. ✅ No remaining incorrect imports found in the codebase

## Best Practices

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Always use the path alias**: When importing Prisma client, use `~/generated/prisma` instead of `@prisma/client`
2. **Check custom output location**: Remember that the Prisma client is generated to `src/generated/prisma`, not the default location
3. **Use the centralized export**: For type exports, you can use `prisma/client.ts` which re-exports from the custom location
4. **Run verification**: Always run `pnpm run verify-prisma` before building to catch import issues early

## Impact on Windows Build Workflow

The Windows build workflow (`.github/workflows/windows-build.yml`) will now succeed because:

1. The `postinstall` script generates the Prisma client to the correct location
2. The `prebuild` script runs the fixed `verify-prisma` which now correctly imports from the custom location
3. The build process can successfully import and use the Prisma client
